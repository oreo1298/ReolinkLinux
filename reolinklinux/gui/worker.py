"""Run blocking camera calls off the GUI thread and deliver results back to it.

``run(fn, done, error)`` executes ``fn()`` on a thread pool; ``done(result)`` or
``error(exc)`` is then called on the GUI thread. The hop back happens through a
queued signal on a QObject that lives in the GUI thread, so plain lambdas are fine
as callbacks. A callback whose widgets were deleted meanwhile is silently skipped.

``SerialQueue`` runs jobs one after another (FIFO): PTZ "move" must reach the camera
before the matching "stop".
